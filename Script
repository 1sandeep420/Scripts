# ssh -i    C:\Users\Lenovo\Downloads\Test_1.pem ubuntu@13.127.82.86   address of the pem file stored in device 
# ls -la :- shows the files in the instance
# vi [FILENAME] : opens the file
# cat/etc/orelease   -  shows the system info 
# current directory : - PWD  [present working directory]
# Change the directory : - CD  [change directory] [directory or file name]
# Going back to the directory  : - cd -   or cd ..   or cd ../..  
# Detailed info including timestamp  : - ls -ltr , if it is starting with D it is a directory or if it is a R it is a file
# create a file : - touch [file name]
# Creating a file and writing inside it  : - vi [file name]   wrire in the file use i  and to save the file :wq!  using cat [filename]  it prints the content in the file  :q is quit 
# Remove the directory :- rm -r [filename]   
# shows the memory data : - free
# number of cpu  : - nproc
# disc size : -df -h
# every info at one place : - top
# man [command name ex :- ls , ls -ltr , touch]: - Detail info about the command like Help
# ls -ltr  : returns the files folders along with timestamp 
# mkdir  :  [Directory name]
# nproc  : Number of CPU
# df : details of the system 

# #!/bin/bash  are the excecutables like a python interpretor , node.js , which inteepretes the bash commands ,   

# #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash are primerly same but due to linking process #!/bin/sh is defaulty pointed to #!/bin/bash 

# echo "Hi iam echo" 
# _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# BASH 
# sh  or else ./ [file name ]  running file
# give permisioon using  : - chmod  777   [4,2,1]
# # considers as command and avoids excecute 
# set -x is used to print the commands used before exceuton 
# ps -ef : - to find the process running is you want to select ps -ef | "your process name "
# | : -  Pipe command used to send the output from one code to another 
# grep "Name or id you want to search " :   is used to filter  running process using letters or words 
# ps -ef | grep python | awk -F " " '{print $2}'    

# extracting from files : - grep free[key word iam describing] Test_file_creation[file name] | awk -F" " '{print $2 }'  [second row]

# when we are excecuting this commans in script in extracting files when their is an error we need to stop at that particular error and exit the script so we use 
# set -e

# if there is a pipe in the command like adjkflj | echo "hello"  defaulty it gets excecuted to avoid this we use 

# set -o   #exits when there is a pipe failure 

# curl file retrives the info from web 

# curl -X GET "https://api.crossref.org/journals?query=pharmacy+health" | jq | grep publisher "retrives the info from API in json format" and filtered through author
# wget "https://api.crossref.org/journals?query=pharmacy+health"  -- this will download the file instead

# sudo su -  goes to the root user logout will exit form the  root user

# sudo find / -name "name of your file " :- for finding all  the files in the system   grep "name" : grep is used to search inside the file

# Why  sudo ?   if we use find / -name ""filename"  it will not show the files comes as permission denied so we use substitute as sudo
# trap  : - is used to trap the signal and avoid excectig it Like when ever SIGNAL SIGINT^C [control c ]  it excutes some task like sending notification , performing tasks 

# ex : -  trap "donot use this " SIGINT^C
#            trap "rm -rf "*  ^CSIGINT     "rm -rf[this will dlt the entire database when this is clicked ]"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------Creating the instances and buckets using aws CLI----------------------------------------------

# AWS command line installation :- 

# 1] install the package from aws console 
# 2] cmd >> aws version [checking the aws version]
# 3]Authoticating with the aws using security credentials 
# 4] aws configure 
# 5] enter the Id , Key , zone , json
# 4] aws s3 ls shows the buckets  (ls-list)
# 5] To create a bucket : - aws s3 mb s3://sandeep-7569785090      {mb - make bucket}
# 4] List of ec2 running : - aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].{ID:InstanceId,State:State.Name,Type:InstanceType,IP:PublicIpAddress}"
